00:00:00 exactly and probably one signal potential is a separate signal physically fit that wanders off somewhere then it's probably a completely independent signal and it's happening at a different frequency from just live here model order selection 
00:00:30 1 2 3 outside however many adults trying to say right we want the smallest number that still adequately explains the shapes that we got a so what problem what specific program of this Thursday suit suit to the machine learning error 
00:01:00 so how many how many seconds is this 22 signal because it's a square one in the spiky ones because they're supposed to be oh that's like the order is the number of things that you using to represent it and we might look at this in a statistical sense because the square thing 
00:01:30 it is not the way this lamp is it might be a little bit and the frequency might not be exactly every hour I say it might be 58 minutes 1 hour 59 minutes the next hour 61 minutes the next hour we can represent examples of statistical model Sofia the first Transformers very deterministic it just says right
